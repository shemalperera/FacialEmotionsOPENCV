# ðŸš€ Real-Time Face Emotion Recognition and Tracking ðŸŽ¥

## Introduction
This project combines Deep Learning and Computer Vision to create an advanced real-time face emotion recognition and tracking system. This project is designed to detect faces, recognize their emotions, and track multiple individuals simultaneously within a video stream or real-time camera feed.

## Development Ladder
- Initial Model Development: Starting off with a CNN model designed to recognize emotions in static images. This initial model was trained on FER 2013 dataset of facial images categorized by emotion. <br>
Below show the Model architecture of Emotion Recognition of static faces. <be>

- The model was trained with 100 epochs and obtained an accuracy of 66.5%. We are in the process of optimizing the model for better accuracy in the meantime.
